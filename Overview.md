### Solution overview
The solution proposed involves the collection of **SQL audit logs** and their near real-time streaming in a simple way, into **Microsoft Fabric** thanks to its simplicity

This efficient process ensures that logs are stored systematically and securely.
Furthermore, the solution offers additional capabilities that are critical for data analysis and management.

Thanks to Fabric's capabilities, include the ability to analyze **audit events with LLM** and the compatibility with various data scientist tools. 

This solution, therefore, not only streamlines the data collection process but also enhances data utility, making it a valuable addition to any data management strategy.

### Architecture
![architecture](./images/overview/architecture.png)|

**1.** SQL Engine generate audit and is configured to send to Event Hub

**2.** Eventstream is connected to eventhub
   
**3.** KQL database ingest data from eventstream

**4.** Through shortcut, data are available into lakehouse

**5.** Reports can be generated leveraging semantic model provided by lakehouse

**Data availability on lakehouse, unlock several capabilities**

**6.** Leverage LLM

**7.** Leverage Fabricâ€™s Data science tools
